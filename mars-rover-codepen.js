/*  Object creations

    We will use two objects in this project : 
        1/ "grid" which represent mars ground : it contains two objects : 
            a) a size which is an array of two number which represent the horizontal and vertical size of the grid
            b) obstacleSet : an array of obstacle. obstacle is an object which will be definied late
        2/ "roverSet" which represent the set of rover. It is an array of rover which will be defined later
    Previous objects contains other objects that we will describe now : 
        1/ "rover" : it contains :
            a) a name 
            b) direction : it is the CURRENT direction. the direction property can contain one of four values: "N", "S", "E", or "W". 
            The roverâ€™s default direction will be "N" (as North).
            c) nextDirection : it is the POTENTIAL NEXT direction. It is computed without taking account of all obstacles on the grid.
            the nextDirection property can contain one of four values: "N", "S", "E", or "W". 
            d) position : an array of two number which give its CURRENT position
            e) nextPosition : it is the POTENTIAL NEXT direction. It is computed without taking account of all obstacles on the grid.
            f) tracking : History of the rover state. It is an array whose each element is an array of 4 components :
                - the two first are the position of the rover
                - the third element is its direction
                - the forth element is its status : ON or OFF
            g) commandSet : a string of command which are These commands will be the first letter of either (f)orward, (b)ackward, 
                (r)ight, or (l)eft.
            h) status : ON or OFF. Indicates if the rover is turn on or off.
        2/ "obstacle". It is an object which contains a position : an array of two number which represent the position of the obstacle.

/*  Move functions

    Moving a rover will depend on various factors : next move could be impossible because the rover will get out the limit of the grid, 
    or because it will crash with another rover. because there could be more than one over on the grid, wee need to manage all rover 
    simultanly, and not one by one. Here is how I tried to solve the probleme.
    
    Condiser move setp t done, here whart will happen a step t+1 : 
    1/  we will compute POTENTIAL new position and direction (nextPosition and nextDirection properties of object rover) for all rover as if
        there were no obstacle. 
    2/  for all rovers, we check rovers that need to stop. Here are the rules for stoping a rover : 
        RULE 1 : the next direction will be out of the grid
        RULE 2 : the rover will crash with an obstacle (the direction have same coordinates than an obstacle)
        RULE 3 : two rovers will crash together. For example rove1: (5,6) -> (6,6) and rover2: (6,5) -> (6,6)
        RULE 4 : Each time a rover stop, all rovers whose new position should be rover current position must stop : this rule is chained rule :
            for example, if one have rover1 : (5,6) -> (6,6), rover2 : (4,6) -> (5,6) and rover3 : (3,6) -> (4,6) and rover1 can't move, 
            then rover2 can't move, and because rover2 can't move, rover3 can't move too.
        When a rover is stopped, it's current position is added to obstacle set
        If a rover follow none of this rules, then it can move : properties direction and position are updated with 
        nextPosition and nextDirection
